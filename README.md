# Python Practice

Welcome to my Python Practice repository! This repository contains a collection of Python scripts and projects that I've created to hone my Python programming skills. From basic syntax and data structures to more advanced topics, this repository serves as a personal learning journey and a showcase of my progress in Python development.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/). This repository's code is written to be compatible with Python 3.x.

To check if Python is installed and to see its version, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python --version
```

### Installation

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sidowxyz/python-practice.git
```

2. Navigate to the repository folder:

```bash
cd python-practice
```

3. Install the required packages (if any are specified):

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the scripts as needed:

```bash
python script_name.py
```

## Usage

Each script in this repository is standalone and demonstrates different Python concepts and functionalities. To use them, simply run the Python file of interest. For example:

```bash
python basics/hello_world.py
```
